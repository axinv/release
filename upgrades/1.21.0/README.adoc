= Upgrade to 1.21.0

== Identity Provider

This release introduces the ability to manage identity providers dynamically from the Management API to handle
authentication through the portal.

It means that it is no more needed to configure identity providers from two locations: the `constants.json` for the UI
and the `gravitee.yml` for the Management API.

Now, you can configure as many identity providers as you need with a cleaner way to configure them.

If you configured an `oauth2` provider in previous versions, you must have to create an identity provider with the `oauth2`
name to preserve compatibility with existing authenticated users. If you did not follow this point, multiples users will
be created for the same user ID.
